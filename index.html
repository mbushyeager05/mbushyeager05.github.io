  <h2>Orgin Story                 </h2>
<p2>When I was a Sophmore in Highschool, I decied to to take a Graphic Design class. I wasn't sure if I would like taking a class like that. I have never taken anything like that before. I always loved art but never really knew much about digiatl art in general. After, taking that class I loved graphic design. This was something that I would love to do as a career. </p2>
